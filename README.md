## Project :computer:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Web App created as a challenge for a job position at Pitang Agile IT.

This web application is a schedule appointments for the COVID-19 Vaccine. Health professionals can make schedules, see and monitor patients appointments and conclude it when the patient took his vaccine.

Focuses on managing appointments for COVID-19 vaccination, following some rules:

- There are 20 vacancies available per day.
- Only 2 appointments can be made at the same scheduled time.
- The time interval between one schedule and another is 1 hour.
- It will only be possible to schedule appointments between 6 AM and 6 PM.
- The patient must inform his/her name, date of birth and day and time for the scheduling.

## Available Scripts :memo:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
